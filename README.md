# SML Assignments

## Overview

This repository contains assignments completed for the course on Statistical Machine Learning (SML). The assignments focus on implementing various machine learning algorithms using SML tools and libraries.

## Contents

1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Implements the PCA algorithm for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. Includes code for eigenvalue decomposition, covariance matrix computation, and projection onto principal components.

2. **Decision Tree**: Implements the Decision Tree algorithm for classification tasks. Includes code for constructing the decision tree, splitting criteria selection, and classification of unseen instances.

3. **Bagging**: Implements the Bagging ensemble learning technique. Includes code for bootstrap sampling, training individual classifiers, and aggregation of predictions.

4. **Boosting**: Implements the Boosting ensemble learning technique, specifically AdaBoost. Includes code for iterative training of weak classifiers, adjusting instance weights, and combining classifier outputs.

5. **Random Forest**: Implements the Random Forest ensemble learning technique. Includes code for constructing multiple decision trees using bootstrap samples and random feature subsets, and aggregating their predictions.

## Conclusion

The SML Assignments repository provides a valuable resource for learning and practicing machine learning techniques. By implementing basic algorithms such as PCA, Decision Trees, Bagging, Boosting, and Random Forests, one can gain foundational knowledge and skills in statistical machine learning.
